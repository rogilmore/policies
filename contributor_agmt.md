# Databrary
## Contributor Agreement

## 1. Overview
Databrary adheres to the principles of the Data Seal of Approval, which, in part, require the authorized data contributor to comply with access regulations imposed both by law and by the data repository, and to conform to codes of conduct that are generally accepted in higher education and scientific research for the exchange of knowledge and information.

These data are distributed under the following terms of use, which are governed by Databrary. Authorized contributors must signify agreement to comply with the requirements stated below.

## 2. Permission to Share
Authorized contributors agree that they have implicit or explicit copyright to the data to be deposited and have the right to make it available through Databrary. Authorized contributors give permission for the data to be used by Databrary for the following purposes: 

1. disseminate the data collection in a variety of formats;
2. promote and advertise the data collection; 
3. describe, catalog, validate and document that data; 
4. store, translate, copy or re-format the data in any way to ensure its future preservation and accessibility; 
5. incorporate metadata or documentation.

Furthermore, authorized contributors agree to give permission to Databrary to enhance, transform and/or rearrange the data, including the data and metadata to protect participant confidentiality or improve usability.

## 3. Privacy of research participants
Any intentional identification of a research participant or unauthorized disclosure of his or her confidential information violates the promise of confidentiality given to the research participant. Therefore, authorized contributors agree to contribute datasets solely for research purposes and not to facilitate the investigation of specific research participants.

Authorized contributors must seek, secure, and maintain permission to conduct research from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or other authority that governs research at their institution. authorized contributors are expected to ensure that the identity of data subjects cannot be easily disclosed. To the extent allowable by law or permitted by the sponsor of the data collection, in preparing this data collection for public archiving and distribution, authorized contributors agree to remove all information directly identifying the research participants in these data, and authorized contributors state that they have used due diligence in preventing information in the collection from being used to disclose the identity of research participants. Authorized contributors agree to tag related files and research participants by identification code.

Research participants must have given explicit permission for data to be shared and the level of sharing that is authorized. Research participants must sign a copy of the Databrary Sharing Permission Form. All data uploaded to Databrary must be tagged indicating what level of sharing a research participant has authorized. If the research participant has not permitted sharing of any data, the data must not be uploaded to Databrary.

## 4. Limitations on Showing or Viewing Data

Authorized users and authorized contributors agree to abide by the preferences expressed by research participants concerning who may view research participants' data, images, or video. There are four levels of sharing permission: 

1. **No sharing (Level 0)**. No research data from individual participants may be shared with other Databrary authorized users. Access to all individual data files is limited to the research team that collects the data. Aggregate results and statistical analyses may be shared, however, provided that they are done so in a way that does not permit individual level data to be imputed[a]. 
2. **Sharing, but no public excerpts permitted (Level 1)**. Research data from individual participants may be shared with other Databrary authorized users and viewed and analyzed by researchers under the supervision of authorized users in the conduct of scientific research. But, no excerpts from recordings may be excerpted or presented in public settings -- in classrooms, at scientific or technical meetings, in the media, in textbooks or scientific publications, or on the Internet[b].
3. **Sharing, public excerpts may be shown but not distributed (Level 2)**. Research data from individual participants may be shared with other Databrary authorized users and viewed and analyzed by researchers under the supervision of authorized users in the conduct of scientific research. Excerpts from audio or video files selected by a Databrary authorized user may be presented in public settings -- in classrooms, at scientific or technical meetings -- but may not be published in the media, in textbooks[c], scientific publications, or on the Internet; 
4. **Sharing, public excerpts may be shown and distributed (Level 3)**. Research data from individual participants may be shared with other Databrary authorized users and viewed and analyzed by researchers under the supervision of authorized users in the conduct of scientific research. Excerpts from audio or video files selected by a Databrary authorized user may be presented in public settings -- in classrooms, at scientific or technical meetings -- and may be published in the media, in textbooks[d], scientific publications, or on the Internet (with citation) as long as no identifying information about the depicted participant is included with the excerpt. 

If there is ambiguity about whether a research participant has granted permission to view a data set, that data must NOT be uploaded by the authorized data contributor or viewed or downloaded by the authorized data user. Any problems or questions should be addressed to Databrary (ethics@databrary.org).

## 5. Redistribution of Data
        
Authorized contributors are encouraged to share the results of their analyses, including metadata with Databrary. Authorized contributors agree to abide by the preferences expressed by research participants concerning how digital files of images or video excerpts of can be shared outside Databrary. Research participants may either deny permission to permit images or video excerpts from digital files to be released outside of Databrary, or give permission to release images or video excerpts from digital files to individuals who are not authorized users of the data library. In authorizing the latter, research participants trust that authorized contributors will exercise professional judgment and uphold ethical principles in determining which images and excerpts to release, to whom, and how.

## 6. Citations

Authorized contributors agree to reference the recommended bibliographic citation in any publication or electronic resource that employs resources provided by Databrary. This will typically involve using the permanent URL provided by Databrary. [Authors of publications based on Databrary data are encouraged to send citations of their published works to Databrary for inclusion in a database of related publications[e].]

## 7. How To Deposit Data

Deposits should include all data and documentation necessary to independently read and interpret the data collection. Databrary encourages authorized contributors to submit video files in their raw formats. ASCII text, spreadsheet, and PDF files are also acceptable as long as they are accompanied with data definition statements. Datasets in other formats are accepted, as well. All identifying information (names, phone numbers, addresses, email addresses, social media accounts or user IDs, birthdates, websites) should be removed from the records to ensure confidentiality.

Documentation files are integral to interpreting a data collection and should thoroughly explain the data collection. Examples of documentation files include codebooks, data collection instruments, summary statistics, project summaries, and bibliographies of publications pertaining to the data. Documentation can be submitted as Microsoft Word, ASCII, and DDI XML files, among other formats.
[f]

Every new or revised Databrary study deposit should include information about the contributor or contributors, information about the study, and information about participants in a study.  Mandatory contributor-level information will include the PI’s name, institution, and a signed data contributor agreement. Mandatory study-level information will include authors’ names, institution where data were collected, study name unique to the contributor’s lab, and relevant IRB protocol approval information. At the research participant level, it is essential that information about appropriate access levels granted by each participant (permissions) be provided. We will use this information to control subsequent access by authorized users. All video files should be tagged the sex and age-at-testing of each participant. In most cases, mandatory information will be provided to and uploaded by use of the Databrary data management tool, but Databrary will also provide a web form[g] alternative to help authorized contributors prepare and compile study description information before depositing data.

## 8. Violations

If Databrary determines that the terms of this agreement have been violated, Databrary will act according to its policy on terms of use violations. Sanctions can include: Databrary may revoke the existing data contribution agreement, remove the data in question, and deny all future access to Databrary data. The violation may be reported to the Research Integrity Officer, Institutional Review Board, or Human Subjects Review Committee of the user's institution.

If Databrary seeks and secures institution-level agreements. [A range of sanctions are available to institutions including revocation of tenure and termination. If the confidentiality of human subjects has been violated, the case may be reported to the Federal Office for Human Research Protections. This may result in an investigation of the user's institution, which can result in institution-wide sanctions including the suspension of all research grants. A court may award the payment of damages to any individual(s)/organization(s) harmed by the breach of the agreement.]

## 9. Disclaimer

Authorized contributors, Databrary, New York University, The Pennsylvania State University, and the relevant funding agency bear no responsibility for use of the data or for interpretations or inferences based upon such uses.
