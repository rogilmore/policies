## Use Agreement

##1. Overview

Databrary adheres to the principles of the Data Seal of Approval, which, in part, require the authorized data user to comply with access regulations imposed both by law and by the data repository, and to conform to codes of conduct that are generally accepted in higher education and scientific research for the exchange of knowledge and information.

These data are distributed under the following terms of use, which are governed by Databrary. Authorized users must signify agreement to comply with the requirements stated below. Authorized users must renew their data use agreements on an annual basis.

## 2. Privacy of research participants

Any intentional identification of a research participant or unauthorized disclosure of his or her confidential information violates the promise of confidentiality given to the research participant. Therefore, authorized users agree to use these data sets solely for research purposes and not for investigation of specific research participants.

Data contributors are expected to ensure that the identity of data subjects cannot be disclosed by tagging related files and research participants by identification code and by omitting information from Databrary that might lead to the identification of individual research participants.

Nevertheless, identifiable images may be recorded on video. Names may be spoken out loud on video or audio. Images or voices of visitors or other people who are not research participants may also be recorded on video or audio. If a study takes place in a home or other setting, aspects of that home or setting may be seen on video. Thus, it is possible that individuals or locations could be identified from recordings inadvertently.

Authorized users agree not to disclose the identity of any person identified inadvertently. Authorized users agree not to attempt to link or permit others to link the data set with individually identifiable records from any other data set. Authorized users agree not to attempt to use the data sets to learn the identity of any person. And, authorized users agree that if the identity of any person should be discovered inadvertently, no use whatsoever will be made of this knowledge.

Authorized users agree to treat data from Databrary with the same high standards of care that they would treat data collected in their own laboratories. The data must be kept in locked laboratories and on computers with password protected access limited to authorized users and researchers under their supervision.

## 3.[a]Limitations on Showing or Viewing Data[b]

Authorized users agree to abide by the preferences expressed by research participants concerning who may view research participants' data, images, or video. There are three levels: no viewing by anyone; viewing by authorized users and researchers under their supervision in the conduct of scientific research; viewing by public audiences for scientific purposes (e.g., professional conferences, talks, or scientific publications) and/or educational purposes (e.g., classroom lectures, workshops). If there is ambiguity about whether a research participant has granted permission to view a data set, that data must NOT be viewed by the authorized data user. Any problems or questions should be addressed to Databrary.

## 4. Redistribution of Data
Authorized users agree not to redistribute data from Databrary. However, authorized users are encouraged to share the results of their analyses, including metadata with Databrary. Authorized users agree also to abide by the preferences expressed by research participants concerning how digital files of images or video excerpts can be shared outside Databrary. Research participants may either deny permission to permit digital files to be released outside of Databrary, or give permission to release digital files to individuals who are not authorized users of the data library. In authorizing the latter, research participants trust that authorized users will exercise professional judgment and uphold ethical principles in determining which files to release, to whom, and how.

## 5. Citing Data
Authorized users agree to reference the recommended bibliographic citation in any publication that employs resources provided by Databrary. This will typically involve using the permanent URL provided by Databrary. [Authors of publications based on Databrary data are encouraged to send citations of their published works to Databrary for inclusion in a database of related publications.]
[c]

## 6. Disclaimer
Authorized users acknowledge that the data contributor(s), Databrary, New York University, The Pennsylvania State University, and the relevant funding agency bear no responsibility for use of the data or for interpretations or inferences based upon such uses.

## 7. Violations

If Databrary determines that the terms of this agreement have been violated, Databrary will act according to its policy on terms of use violations. Sanctions can include: Databrary may revoke the existing data use agreement, demand the return of the data in question, and deny all future access to Databrary data. The violation may be reported to the Research Integrity Officer, Institutional Review Board, or Human Subjects Review Committee of the user's institution.

If Databrary seeks and secures institution-level agreements. [A range of sanctions are available to institutions including revocation of tenure and termination. If the confidentiality of human subjects has been violated, the case may be reported to the Federal Office for Human Research Protections. This may result in an investigation of the user's institution, which can result in institution-wide sanctions including the suspension of all research grants. A court may award the payment of damages to any individual(s)/organization(s) harmed by the breach of the agreement.]

## 8. Definitions

_Authorized Data User_

A faculty member, staff member, or student conducting research that is supervised and has been approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or its equivalent and who has received authorization from Databrary to access data.

_Authorized Data Contributor_

_Promise of Confidentiality_

A promise to a respondent or research participant that the information the respondent provides will not be disseminated without the permission of the respondent; that the fact that the respondent participated in the study will not be disclosed; and that disseminated information will include no linkages to the identity of the respondent. Such a promise encompasses traditional notions of both confidentiality and anonymity[d]. Names and other identifying information regarding respondents, proxies, or other persons on whom the respondent or proxy provides information, are presumed to be confidential.

_Research Participant_

[a]xc11:
Is this section going to look the same as the contributor agreements, or stay like this?
[b]Andrea Seisler:
This section doesn't mention anything about written publications.
[c]Andrea Seisler:
I would put the exact citation when it becomes available.
[d]Andrea Seisler:
based on the nature of the data (video, images, voice)  the IRB will likely want this word to be removed.
